                        At "World of Bears" our mission is clear: we're dedicated to the preservation of bears and promoting the idea that bears and humans can peacefully coexist. We believe in fostering a world where these majestic creatures thrive in their natural habitats while also ensuring the safety and well-being of communities living nearby. Join us in our commitment to harmony between bears and humans, as we work towards a future where both can share the same space with respect and understanding. Together, we can make a world where bears are not just preserved, but celebrated as a vital part of our global ecosystem.

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">Bear Endangered</h4>
                    <p class="description">
                        Bear endangerment is a pressing concern in today's world. These iconic creatures face numerous threats, including habitat loss, poaching, and climate change. As we continue to encroach upon their territories, it's crucial to raise awareness and take action to protect these magnificent animals. Conservation efforts are vital to ensure the survival of bear species and maintain the ecological balance of our planet. Let's work together to secure a future where bears continue to roam our wilderness, enriching our world with their presence.

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">People & Bears Can Co-Exist </h4>
                    <p class="description">
                        People need correct information about bear behaviour and their biological requirements. This allows an appreciation for these animals and encourages the will to coexist. People and bears can coexist. We just need to know more about the bear as it really is, not the bear that exists in our head. Learn more at Wise About Bears.
                        Bears are very strong and quick. Bears have the capability to be dangerous, however the possibility of a bear harming people is overstated . Bears have the power to inflict great damage but for some reason they exhibit tremendous restraint when dealing with people. Bears that allow themselves to be seen by people donâ€™t tend to be a threat to human safety.
                        Education about bear behaviour and changing human behaviour will reduce human/bear conflicts. Education will also reduce the need to live trap and relocate or worse still, kill the bear. Relocation of a bear should be a last resort to solving a people/bear conflict. A good reason for relocating a bear is when human activity is too hard to manage. Examples are parks, schools and areas where the number of people reduce the opportunity to encourage the bear to move on by removing the attractant (ie-peoples food, bird seed, food for pets).
